How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It was much easier to use the diff command
than to try and do the comparison manually. This
was especially true when one tried to compare
long files. diff -u did the job much easier.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It would mean that you could easily rollback changes if needed.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

You will have more control but you also might forget.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

This helps you track changes when coding.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

You can do it very carefully.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Becasue you know you can always get back the old copy that works.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

My workplace is not working!
